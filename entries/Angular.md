# Angular

Angular is a popular open-source JavaScript framework for building web applications. Developed and maintained by Google, it provides a structured and organized way to create dynamic and interactive single-page applications (SPAs). Angular is written in TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript, making it a powerful and feature-rich framework for web development.



## Key Features



1. **Component-Based Architecture**: Angular uses a component-based architecture, where your application is broken down into reusable components, such as headers, footers, and content sections. This promotes modularity and maintainability.



2. **Two-Way Data Binding**: Angular provides powerful two-way data binding, allowing seamless synchronization between the model and the view. Changes in the model are automatically reflected in the view and vice versa.



3. **Dependency Injection**: Angular's built-in dependency injection system helps manage dependencies and promotes code reusability. This is essential for building scalable and maintainable applications.



4. **Directives**: Angular includes a wide range of built-in directives like `ngIf`, `ngFor`, and `ngStyle` that help you manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) based on your application's data.



5. **Services**: Services in Angular are used to share data, business logic, and other common functionality across components. This promotes the "DRY" (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.



6. **Routing**: Angular offers powerful routing capabilities that enable the creation of single-page applications with multiple views. The Angular Router makes it easy to navigate between different parts of your application.



7. **Forms**: Angular provides robust support for forms, including template-driven and reactive forms, form validation, and handling form submissions.



8. **HTTP Client**: The Angular HTTP client simplifies making HTTP requests and handling responses, making it easy to interact with back-end APIs.



## Ecosystem



Angular has a rich ecosystem that includes a variety of tools and libraries to enhance your development experience:



- **Angular CLI**: A command-line tool for initializing, developing, and maintaining Angular applications.



- **Angular Material**: A UI component library that provides pre-designed, customizable components to build beautiful and responsive web applications.



- **RxJS**: A powerful library for handling asynchronous operations and managing data streams.



## Versions



There are two major versions of Angular:



- **AngularJS**: The original version, often referred to as Angular 1.x. It's based on JavaScript and is less modular than its successor. It's not actively maintained.



- **Angular (2+)**: This is the modern version of Angular, and it's based on TypeScript. It's modular, component-driven, and actively maintained by the Angular team. The latest stable version at the time of writing is Angular 12.
