# Background
Wikipedia is an accessible online encyclopedia comprising numerous entries covering a wide range of topics. To view a specific entry, one can navigate to its dedicated page, such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML, which displays the Wikipedia entry for HTML. Notably, the requested page's name (HTML) is indicated in the route /wiki/HTML, and the page content is essentially HTML code rendered by the browser.

In practical terms, it would become cumbersome if every Wikipedia page had to be composed in HTML. Therefore, it is more convenient to use a lightweight, user-friendly markup language to store encyclopedia entries. While Wikipedia utilizes Wikitext as its markup language, we will employ Markdown for this project.

To understand Markdown syntax, refer to GitHub's Markdown guide, paying specific attention to formatting elements like headings, bold text, links, and lists. Adopting a one-Markdown-file-per-entry approach enhances the ease of writing and editing entries. However, when a user accesses an encyclopedia entry, we must convert the Markdown content into HTML before presenting it to the user.
